A VR game built for promoting the progressive rock band TesseracT's latest album "War of Being". Early release on steam comprised of a proof of concept that included the bands latest single exclusively released in game 1-week prior to the official video release. Early access can be found on [the steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475790/War_Of_Being/) 

The full release is still WIP, with all game systems being developed by myself, working alongside the art and design teams.  Latest progress can be found over on the [Official TesseracT youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TesseractOfficial/videos) through kickstarter update videos. 

Early access released in July 2023, with overwhelmingly positive feedback from the community, spurring Daniel to broaden the scope of the final product to add much grander mechanics and dive deeper into the lore surrounding the concept album.
